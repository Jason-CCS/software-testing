# Requirement Document

As said before, SDLC involves some phases to develop a good software.

The very first thing is what you want to do and write down on a requirement list.
Here give an example:

> We got a website user interface to test. The most important function probably is the login module.
> So, for the health of the login function, we will need some requirements for this function.
> Shown as below lists only two requirements for demonstrative purpose.
>
> The requirements of login module: <br>
> 1.1 Sign-in module will have a username and password field. User should be able to enter their credentials on those 
> fields and click on login button for accessing their accounts <br>
> 1.2 There should be a forgot password link, users should be able to click and retrieve their password through this 
> link.

Above is a very very simple and short example to demo a requirement document. Of course in real life, a website 
consists of lots of modules and functions.

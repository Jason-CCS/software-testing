# Requirement Document

As said before, SDLC involves some phases to develop a good software.
The first one is what you want to do and diverge into a requirement list.
Here give an example: we got a website user interface to test. The most important function probably is the login module.
So, for the health of the login function, we will need some requirement for this function.
Before that, requirements from product owner or PM, or whatever are mostly written down to a document.
Shown as below is just a very short example.

Login module:
1.1 Sign-in module will have a username and password field. User should be able to enter their credentials on those fields and click on Login for accessing their accounts
1.2 There should be a forgot password link, users should be able to click and retrieve their password through this link.
